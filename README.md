# no_reservations

This project is for a code test for a restaurant booking application.


Some tools utilized in the project include the following:

  Styling: SCSS, Bourbon
  Gems: Cancancan, Devise, Carrierwave and RMagick for image uploads.



Future Work: I would like to complete the implementation of Geocoder in the future. This would allow me to display a user's proximity to any given restaurant.
